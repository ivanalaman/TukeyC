Description: Provides tools to perform multiple comparison analyses, based on the well-known Tukey's "Honestly Significant Difference" (HSD) test. In models involving interactions, 'TukeyC' stands out from other R packages by implementing intuitive and easy-to-use functions. In addition to accommodating traditional R methods such as lm() and aov(), it has also been extended to objects of the lmer() class, that is, mixed models with fixed effects. For more details see Tukey (1949) <doi:10.2307/3001913>.
